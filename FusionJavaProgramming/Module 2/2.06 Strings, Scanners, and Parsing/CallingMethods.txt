    1. Method Signature - The method declaration that includes the name of the method and the parameters.

    2. Return Type - Methods can be either void or return types. A void function will not send back information to where the funciton was called.
        Return types will return information back to the funciton call based on the type indicated.
    
    3. Parameters - These are the inputs required by the method in order to accomplish the task.

    4. Arguments - These are the values that are sent as part of the function call.

    5. Function Call - We use the name of the method to call on the funciton. We must match arguments with the intended parameter types.
